This directory contains the test suite for the smartcard.scard wrapper of 
the C language SCardXXX API.  

You will need two smart card readers and two smart cards to run the test 
suite.  Insert the readers and the cards in the readers before executing 
the test suite.  

On the first execution of the test suite, the configcheck.py script in the 
parent directory will generate a localconfig.py file that will contain the 
current names of the readers and ATRs of the cards inserted in the 
readers.  These data are used by the test suite.  If you change the test 
configuration, i.e.  add or remove readers or cards, or change the readers 
or cards, just delete localconfig.py and re-run the test suite.
