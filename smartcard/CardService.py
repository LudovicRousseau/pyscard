"""Card service abstract class.

A card service is a class providings specific smart card functionality,
e.g.  a GSM file system or an Open Platform loader.  CardService is an
abstract class from which concrete card services are derived.  A concrete
card service is almost always smart card operating system specific.

The card service performs its specific smart card functionnality by accessing
the smartcard with a CardConnection.
