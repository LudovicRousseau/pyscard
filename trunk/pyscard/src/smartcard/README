Last update : pyscard 1.6.12 (August 2010)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pyscard is a python module adding smart cards support to python.

It consists of the smartcard.scard module, an extension module wrapping Windows
smart card base components (also known as PCSC) on Windows, and PCSC lite on
linux and Mac OS X Tiger, and of the smartcard module, a python framework with
objects wrapping PCSC API.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All documentation is provided in the smartcard/doc directory of the source
distribution.  Examples are provided in the smartcard/Examples directory of the
source distribution.  The binary distribution does not include any
documentation, tests scripts or examples.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pyscard library is packaged using the standard distutils python module.

Installation on windows
-----------------------

Installing on windows from the binary distribution
--------------------------------------------------

1. download the binary msi installer or self-executable installer
2. execute the installer

The binary msi installer and self-executable installer are packaged for a
specific version of python, and have name similar to
pyscard-1.6.12.win32-py2.5.msi and pyscard-1.6.12.win32-py2.5.exe for
python 2.5.


Installing on windows from the source distribution
---------------------------------------------------

1. you will need swig 1.3.31 from http://www.swig.org, and a C compiler.

By default, Visual Studio 2003 is required for building the c language wrapper
for python 2.5, and Visual Studio .Net or VisualC++ 6 for python 2.4.  You might
use another release by fiddling with the python/Lib/distutils/msvccompiler.py
file that detects the compiler.

2. download the source distribution

The source distribution is available as pyscard-1.6.12.zip for windows,
and pyscard-1.6.12.tar.gz for linux.

3. unzip the source distribution, open a console and type the following:

setup.py build_ext install

This will build pyscard and install it in the site-packages directory of
your python distribution, e.g. c:\python25\Lib\site-packages\smartcard.

This install procedure does not install the documentation, examples or test
files.

Installation on linux:
----------------------

Installing on linux from the binary distribution:
-------------------------------------------------

1. download the binary distribution

The binary distribution is either an archive file or a rpm file, with

Build instructions for packagers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a binary distribution for Windows
------------------------------------------

To build a binary distribution from the source distribution, you will need a C
compiler and swig 1.3.31 (same requirements as for installing from the source
distribution).

In the root directory of the source distribution, execute the following command
in a console:

setup.py build_ext bdist_msi
setup.py build_ext bdist_wininst

This will build the msi installer and self-executable installer in the dist
directory, with names similar to pyscard-1.6.12.win32-py2.5.msi and
pyscard-1.6.12.win32-py2.5.exe for python 2.5, and
pyscard-1.6.12.win32-py2.4.msi and pyscard-1.6.12.win32-py2.4.exe for
python 2.4.

Building a binary distribution for linux
----------------------------------------

To build a binary distribution from the source distribution, you will need
gcc, swig 1.3.31 and pcsc-lite (same requirements as for installing from the
source distribution).

In the root directory of the source distribution, execute the following
command in a terminal:

/usr/bin/python setup.py build_ext bdist

This will build a package similar to pyscard-1.6.12.linux-i686.tar.gz
containing a tree

Building a rpm distribution for linux
----------------------------------------

To build a rpm distribution from the source distribution, you will need
gcc, swig 1.3.31 and pcsc-lite (same requirements as for installing from the
source distribution).

In the root directory of the source distribution, execute the following
command in a terminal:

/usr/bin/python setup.py build bdist_rpm

If you have rpm 4.1 or above, you will need to add the
%_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0 options to the /etc/rpm/macros file,
e.g.:

echo "%_unpackaged_files_terminate_build        0" >> /etc/rpm/macros

This will build in the dist directory a binary distribution with a name
similar to pyscard-1.6.12-1.i386.rpm.

Building a binary distribution for Mac OS X Tiger
-------------------------------------------------

To build a binary distribution from the source distribution, you will need
swig 1.3.31 (same requirements as for installing from the source distribution)
and bdist_mpkg 0.4.3 (http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/bdist_mpkg/).


If you are using the pre-installed python 2.3 distribution, in the root directory
of the source distribution, i.e. in the src directory, execute the following commands
in a terminal:

python setup.py build_ext
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework/Versions/2.3/bin/bdist_mpkg setup.py

This will build package pyscard-1.6.12-py-2.3-macosx10.4.mpkg.

If you are using python 2.5, in the root directory of the source distribution,
i.e. in the src directory, execute the following commands in a terminal:

python setup.py build_ext
/Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework/Versions/2.5/bin/bdist_mpkg setup.py

This will build package pyscard-1.6.12-py-2.6-macosx10.4.mpkg.


Building a binary distribution for Mac OS X Leopard
---------------------------------------------------

To build a binary distribution from the source distribution, you will need
swig 1.3.31 (same requirements as for installing from the source distribution)
and bdist_mpkg 0.4.3 (http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/bdist_mpkg/).

Apply the following patch to tools.py of bdist_mpkg package:

===== patch end ========

This patch is required since Mac OS X Leopard does not have the nidump command any more.

Install bdist_mpkg by executing the bdist_mpkg setup.py script with build and
install as arguments, i.e. from the root directory of the bdist_mpkg
source distribution enter: python setup.py build install.

For python 2.5, from the root directory of the pyscard source distribution,
i.e. in the src directory, execute the following commands in a terminal:

python setup.py build_ext
/Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework/Versions/2.5/Extras/bin/bdist_mpkg setup.py

This will build package pyscard-1.6.12-py-2.5-macosx10.5.mpkg.

For python 2.6, from the root directory of the pyscard source distribution,
i.e. in the src directory, execute the following commands in a terminal:

python setup.py build_ext
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin/bdist_mpkg setup.py

This will build package pyscard-1.6.12-py-2.6-macosx10.5.mpkg.
